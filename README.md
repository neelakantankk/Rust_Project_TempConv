# Rust_Project_TempConv
Rust book - Chapter 3 - Program to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit

This program is the first of the three given at the end of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-05-control-flow.html">Chapter 3 of the Rust book</a>. It asks the user whether they want to convert from °F to °C or vice versa. It currently uses match expressions instead of the if that it originally did.
